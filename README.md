SDLC

I interpret user needs based on what they want from a piece of software.  The user stories help define what it is a user wants.  Then, I can take that user story and break it down into different requirements for the project.  Some of these things will be directly stated from the users, other will be infered, but I can always ask for clarification later on when a decision must be made.

I develop my programs by just getting something that works at first.  Doesn't matter how easy or elegant the answer is, I just want it to function.  Then I can go back and start refining and refactoring the code, making pieces that are used multiple times into a function, cleaning up redundancies and so forth.  I am hopinh to add Test Driven Development into my future coding practices.  I really want to make sure that as I am creating I have the test goal to work for, that way I don't forget some requirement.

Being a good team member is best achieve through open, and honest, commmunication.  You don't have to be the best, you don't have to do it all, but you have to be able to admit to what you aren't good at, and what is holding you back.
